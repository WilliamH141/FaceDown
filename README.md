 # FaceDown 📱

**FaceDown** is an iOS app (built with SwiftUI) that helps you stay focused by placing your phone face-down.  
If you pick up or move your device during a focus session, the app can detect it and break the streak.  
The goal is to reduce distractions and build accountability — especially when working or studying with friends.
