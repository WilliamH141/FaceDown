# FaceDown üì±

**FaceDown** is an iOS app (built with SwiftUI) that helps you stay focused by placing your phone face-down.  
If you pick up or move your device during a focus session, the app can detect it and break the streak.  
The goal is to reduce distractions and build accountability ‚Äî especially when working or studying with friends.

## üì¶ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Xcode 16 or later
- iOS 17.0+ target device (motion sensors required)
- Firebase account

### Setup
1. Clone this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/WilliamH141/FaceDown.git
   ```

2. Follow the Firebase setup guide in [`FIREBASE_SETUP.md`](FIREBASE_SETUP.md)

3. Open `FaceDown.xcodeproj` in Xcode

4. Build and run on a **real device** (simulator doesn't support motion sensors)

## üéØ How It Works

1. **Start a Session** - Choose 5, 25, or 50 minute focus session
2. **Place Phone Face-Down** - Put your phone face-down on a stable surface
3. **Stay Focused** - The app monitors:
   - Face-down orientation (via accelerometer)
   - Steady state (via gyroscope)
4. **View Results** - After session ends, see your stats:
   - Pass if **‚â•80% face down** AND **‚â•70% steady**
   - Fail otherwise

## üìä Session Criteria

| Metric | Threshold | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Face Down % | ‚â• 80% | Phone must be face-down |
| Steady % | ‚â• 70% | Phone must remain still |
| Duration | Full session | Complete the timer |
